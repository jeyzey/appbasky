## Seamless Deployments

The fastest way for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications in one open source platform. AppBasky enables developers and engineers to stay more productive with its zero configuration deployments.

* Python
* C#
* PHP
* Node.js
* Java

## Integration

Our integration with Github, GitLab and Bitbucket means every push to git and your static website will be live with zero configuration required. Every AppBasky project comes with free custom domain support and free SSL certificate.
